# Cyber Crime Investigation and Digital Forensics: A Practical Perspective from TryHackMe Cybersecurity 101

## Introduction

The digital revolution has transformed nearly every aspect of modern life — communication, business, education, and even crime. As technology advances, **cyber crimes** have become increasingly complex and global in nature, involving everything from financial fraud and data breaches to ransomware and espionage. To counter these threats, professionals in **Cyber Crime Investigation** and **Digital Forensics** play a vital role in uncovering the truth hidden in digital evidence.

This article presents a comprehensive overview of how cyber crime investigations are conducted using digital forensic methods. Drawing upon knowledge gained from the **TryHackMe Cybersecurity 101** learning path, it explores the process, tools, and ethical considerations involved in the digital investigation lifecycle.

## Understanding Cyber Crime

Cyber crime refers to any criminal activity involving computers, networks, or digital devices. These crimes often exploit vulnerabilities in systems, software, or human behavior to achieve malicious goals. Common types include:

- **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Deceptive tactics to steal user credentials or personal data.
- **Ransomware Attacks:** Encrypting victim data and demanding ransom for decryption keys.
- **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized access to confidential corporate or personal information.
- **Identity Theft:** Misusing digital identities for fraud or deception.
- **Cyber Espionage:** State-sponsored or organized theft of classified or strategic information.

Each of these crimes leaves behind digital footprints — network packets, logs, file metadata, deleted files, or system traces — which become the foundation of a digital forensic investigation.

## What is Digital Forensics?

**Digital Forensics** is the scientific process of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence in a way that is legally defensible. Its core objective is to extract reliable evidence that can explain “what happened,” “how it happened,” “who did it,” and “when it occurred.”

Digital forensics encompasses several sub-disciplines:
- **Computer Forensics:** Examining data on desktops, laptops, and servers.
- **Network Forensics:** Capturing and analyzing network traffic for evidence of intrusion.
- **Mobile Device Forensics:** Extracting data from smartphones and tablets.
- **Memory (RAM) Forensics:** Investigating volatile memory to detect running malware.
- **Cloud Forensics:** Analyzing digital evidence stored in distributed cloud environments.

## The Digital Forensics Process

Digital forensic investigations must follow a structured and repeatable methodology to ensure the integrity of evidence. The process generally includes six key stages:

D --> E[Interpretation and Correlation of Findings]
E --> F[Documentation and Legal Presentation]
````

### 1. Identification

The investigation begins with identifying potential sources of evidence. These may include:

* Hard drives, USBs, and SSDs.
* Network routers, firewalls, and server logs.
* Cloud service logs and databases.
* Volatile memory (RAM) captures.
* Mobile devices or IoT sensors.

In the TryHackMe **"Network Fundamentals"** room, I learned how different network components store logs, which can later be used to trace malicious activity — a key skill in this phase.

---

### 2. Preservation

Once evidence sources are identified, it is critical to **preserve them** in an unaltered state. Investigators use write-blockers and imaging tools to prevent any modification of original data. A **Chain of Custody** document is maintained to record who accessed the evidence, when, and for what purpose.

For example:

* The **FTK Imager** tool can create exact bit-by-bit copies of storage media.
* **Hash values (MD5/SHA-256)** are calculated before and after imaging to verify data integrity.

---

### 3. Collection

During this stage, evidence is collected in a forensically sound manner. Methods differ depending on the evidence type:

* **Disk Imaging:** Capturing an entire drive using tools like `dd` or **FTK Imager**.
* **Memory Dumping:** Extracting RAM content using **Volatility** or **DumpIt**.
* **Log Collection:** Copying system, web, and firewall logs for later correlation.
* **Network Capture:** Using **Wireshark** or **tcpdump** to collect network packets.

The **TryHackMe “Intro to Network Traffic Analysis”** lab demonstrated packet capture techniques — an essential skill for investigators analyzing cyber intrusions.

---

### 4. Examination and Analysis

This stage involves deep technical analysis of the collected evidence. Analysts use a range of tools and methodologies to uncover hidden data, reconstruct user actions, or detect artifacts left by malware.

Examples include:

* Recovering deleted files or registry entries using **Autopsy** or **EnCase**.
* Detecting persistence mechanisms or suspicious startup entries.
* Analyzing executable files using **strings**, **VirusTotal**, or **IDA Free**.
* Correlating network logs to identify command-and-control (C2) activity.

In TryHackMe’s **“Intro to Digital Forensics”** exercises, I learned how timestamps, file signatures, and hash comparisons can reveal tampered or malicious files — key elements in real investigations.

---

### 5. Interpretation and Correlation

Once individual artifacts are examined, they are correlated to form a coherent timeline. Investigators look for **attack patterns**, **entry points**, and **sequence of events**.

A simplified **attack timeline reconstruction** might look like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant Attacker
participant VictimSystem
participant Server
participant Investigator

Attacker->>VictimSystem: Phishing Email with Malicious Attachment
VictimSystem->>Server: Downloads Malware Payload
Server-->>VictimSystem: Establishes C2 Connection
VictimSystem->>Attacker: Exfiltrates Sensitive Data
Investigator->>VictimSystem: Acquires Disk Image
Investigator->>Server: Analyzes Logs to Trace IP and Timestamps
Investigator->>Attacker: Correlates Digital Evidence for Attribution
```

This correlation helps investigators answer critical questions: **How did the attacker gain access? What actions were taken? Which data was compromised?**

---

### 6. Reporting and Presentation

Finally, investigators compile their findings into a detailed **forensic report**. This report must be:

* **Comprehensive:** Clearly documenting tools, methods, and results.
* **Legally sound:** Maintaining evidential integrity and chain of custody.
* **Understandable:** Written in language accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences (e.g., law enforcement or legal teams).

Reports typically include:

* Summary of the incident.
* Description of evidence acquisition and tools used.
* Analysis results and timelines.
* Conclusion and recommendations.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Digital forensics must operate under strict **legal and ethical guidelines**, ensuring that evidence collection respects individual rights and complies with data protection laws.

Key principles include:

* **Chain of Custody:** Every movement or access to evidence must be logged.
* **Data Privacy Compliance:** Adhering to frameworks like GDPR or the Indian IT Act (2000).
* **Authorization and Scope:** Forensic analysis should never exceed the investigation’s legal boundaries.
* **Objectivity:** Analysts must remain unbiased and report only factual findings.

Violating these principles can result in evidence being disqualified in court or lead to ethical breaches.
